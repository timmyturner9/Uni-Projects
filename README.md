This repository contains selected academic and independent projects focused on data analysis, machine learning, and applied statistics.
Each project demonstrates practical experience with analytical tools (Python, RapidMiner, BigML) and data-driven problem solving across healthcare and business contexts.

 Projects
Stroke Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning

Tools: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Summary:
Developed a machine learning pipeline to predict stroke occurrence based on demographic and health indicators.
Implemented EDA, feature engineering, and model evaluation (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression).
Focused on handling class imbalance, improving interpretability, and visualizing model results.


Heart Failure Data Mining — CRISP-DM Framework

Tools: BigML, Excel
Summary:
Applied the CRISP-DM methodology to explore the HeartBit medical dataset (469 patients).
Conducted classification, clustering, and association rule analysis to identify key predictors of patient condition.
Dealt with missing values, feature redundancy, and evaluation of models such as decision trees and association rules.


Breast Cancer Classification — RapidMiner & BigML Comparison

Tools: RapidMiner, BigML
Summary:
Compared five ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, k-NN, Decision Tree, Random Forest) on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.
Evaluated models using cross-validation and multiple performance metrics to assess accuracy, precision, and recall.
Identified Logistic Regression as the most stable and interpretable model.
